	 <p>Hairdressing Scissors:  The number of professional hair stylists and barbers are increasing year on year, and advice on hairdressing scissors is becoming more and more important and sought after. In our view one of the most important pieces of equipment 
	 for a hairdresser/barber  are the scissors they have to use. The many different types of scissors in today's market is mind boggling. So with all this choice and all scissor companies claiming to have the best, it's no surprise to us that even professionals get a bit confused when it comes to choosing what's best 
	 suited to their needs. How  does one know which pair to go for? Well at Bladesmaster we not only sell and service scissors but we also advise our customers on which scissors are best suited to them,based on several different factors. We have extensive experience in this gained from having been in the industry in various capacities for a great 
	 number of years. Below we have listed the criterion which we think will greatly improve your  chances of buying the right scissors.</p>
	 
	 <p>Firstly think Blades. What are they are made of???  The most important factor when deciding on which hairdressing scissors to pick  and when trying to figure out how your scissors will perform, is the material they are made of. Scissor manufacturing techniques have improved greatly over the years and  means that they can 
	 now be produced in much harder material than was ever possible in years gone by. Here is a list of the five most common materials used in professional hairdressing scissors.

			<li>Store your knives in a safe place, such as a knife block, cardboard covers, or magnetic holder.</li>
			<li>Using a steel on your knives will help maintain to edge. There are many websites showing the proper use of a steel.</li>
		</ol>

		<ol>
			<li>Only use fabric shears on fabric. Paper or other hard materials may damage your scissors edge.</li>
			<li>Keep your scissors clean and dry.</li>
			<li>Store your scissors in a safe place.</li>
			<li>Scissors covers can be purchased at most fabric stores. Covers can help to protect the cutting edges of your scissors.</li>
		</ol>
	 
	   <p><strong>How to keep your garden tools sharp:</strong></p>
		<ol>
		   <li>Keep your tools clean and dry. Basic tool oil, such as 3 in 1 oil, will keep your tools clean and moving well.</li>
		   <li>Store your tools in a safe place. Store your tools in such a  way that they won&rsquo;t be exposed to other tools or easily damaged by other  tools.</li>
		   <li>When using your mower blade try to stay away from rocks, sticks,  and landscaping. This will help to maintain the edge on your blade.</li>
		</ol>
