	  <p><strong>How to keep your knives sharp:</strong></p>
	  <ol>
		  <li>Only hand wash your knives. The dishwasher is very hard on delicate knife edges.</li>
		  <li>When using your knives be sure to use a cutting board. A wooden board is recommended.</li>
		  <li>Store your knives in a safe place, such as a knife block, cardboard covers, or magnetic holder.</li>
		  <li>Using a steel on your knives will help maintain to edge. There are many websites showing the proper use of a steel.</li>
	  </ol>
	 <br>
	 <p><strong>How to keep you scissors sharp:</strong></p>
	  <ol>
		  <li>Only use fabric shears on fabric. Paper or other hard materials may damage your scissors edge.</li>
		  <li>Keep your scissors clean and dry.</li>
		  <li>Store your scissors in a safe place.</li>
		  <li>Scissors covers can be purchased at most fabric stores. Covers can help to protect the cutting edges of your scissors.</li>
	  </ol>
	 <br>
	 <p><strong>How to keep your garden tools sharp:</strong></p>
	 <ol>
		 <li>Keep your tools clean and dry. Basic tool oil, such as 3 in 1 oil, will keep your tools clean and moving well.</li>
		 <li>Store your tools in a safe place. Store your tools in such a  way that they won&rsquo;t be exposed to other tools or easily damaged by other  tools.</li>
		 <li>When using your mower blade try to stay away from rocks, sticks,  and landscaping. This will help to maintain the edge on your blade.</li>
